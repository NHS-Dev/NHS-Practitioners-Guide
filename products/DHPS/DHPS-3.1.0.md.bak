# **Deterministic Hydrologic Prediction System (DHPS)**

## **Overview**

<p>

DHPS is a river routing system that is part of Environment Canada's GEM-Hydro forecasting system,
and is the river routing component of NSRPS. DHPS performs the routing of liquid water leaving the surface
model (SPS), which is then conveyed in streams and lakes throughout the modelling domain. DHPS only routes water generated by the surface model, and generally
does not add or remove water to or from the outputs of the surface model.

## **Domain** 

<p> 
Outputs from DHPS are currently implemented at a 1-km resolution over six major river basins representing ~50% of Canada.

DHPS is currently established in the following basins: 
<ul>
<li> Yukon River Basin </li>
<li> Mackenzie River Basin </li>
<li> Nelson River Basin  </li>
<li> Churchill River Basin </li>
<li> Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River Basin </li>
</ul> 
</p>

DHPS also estimates the water budget of large specified water bodies, which include:
<li> The five Laurentian Great Lakes </li>
<li> Lake Champlain </li>
<li> Lake Athabasca  </li>
<li> Great Slave Lake </li>
<li> Great Bear Lake </li>

## **System Description**

<p>

DHPS both analyses and forecasts, routing water from CaLDAS-Sat and HRDLPS, respectively, through a river basin’s lakes and 
rivers at a 1-km grid resolution. It simulates lake levels for defined lakes or reservoirs and streamflow for all other points 
throughout the domain. DHPS is based on the Watroute routing scheme, and has the ability to represent reservoirs with a natural behavior as well as flow diversions.
DHPS is forced with CaLDAS-Sat for the assimilation phase, and with HRDLPS for the forecast phase. 
DHPS assimilates streamflow observations during the data assimilation cycle. Currently, DHPS  assimilates 
observations from ECCC’s Water Survey of Canada, USGS, and the provincial networks of river gauges in Quebec and Alberta.

### **Products**
<p>
DHPS produces analyses in near real-time and forecasts over the next six days. From the 
analyses and forecasts, DHPS provides hourly estimates of river discharge, the volume of water 
stored in the river channel or at the outlet of an explicitly represented natural lake or regulated 
reservoir, and the depth of the water in the subterranean reservoir. DHPS also 
provides analyses and forecasts of precipitation, evaporation and terrestrial runoff averaged 
over the surface of specified large lakes during successive 12-hour periods.
