## **Deterministic Hydrologic Prediction System (DHPS)**

### **Overview**

<p>
DHPS is a river routing system that is part of Environment Canada's GEM-Hydro forecasting system,
and is the river routing component of <a href = "../../NSRPS/nsrps-3.1.0"> NSRPS </a>. DHPS performs the routing of liquid water leaving the surface
model, which is then conveyed in streams and lakes throughout the modelling domain. DHPS only routes water generated by the surface model, and generally
does not add or remove water to or from the outputs of the surface model. DHPS both analyses and forecasts water routed from <a href = "../../CALDAS-SAT/CALDAS-SAT-2.1.3"> CaLDAS-Sat </a> and <a href = "../../HRDLPS/HRDLPS-2.0"> HRDLPS </a>(respectively) through a river basin’s lakes and 
rivers at a 1-km grid resolution. It simulates lake levels for defined lakes (listed below) or reservoirs and streamflow for all other points 
throughout the domain. DHPS is based on the Watroute routing scheme, and has the ability to represent reservoirs with a natural behavior as well as flow diversions.
DHPS also assimilates streamflow observations during the data assimilation cycle. Currently, DHPS  assimilates 
observations from ECCC’s Water Survey of Canada, USGS, and the provincial networks of river gauges in Quebec and Alberta.

### **What is the spatial resolution and coverage of this data?**

<p> 
Outputs from DHPS are currently implemented at a 1-km resolution over six major river basins representing ~50% of Canada.

DHPS is currently established in the following basins: 
<ul>
<li> Yukon River Basin </li>
<li> Mackenzie River Basin </li>
<li> Nelson River Basin  </li>
<li> Churchill River Basin </li>
<li> Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River Basin </li>
</ul> 
</p>

DHPS also estimates the water budget of large specified water bodies, which include:
<li> The five Laurentian Great Lakes </li>
<li> Lake Champlain </li>
<li> Lake Athabasca  </li>
<li> Great Slave Lake </li>
<li> Great Bear Lake </li>

### **What is available?**

<details>
<summary>What is the timestep and time period covered by this data? </summary>
<br>
Twice a day, launching at 00 and 12 UTC, DHPS performs a 12-h data assimilation cycle followed by a 6-day forecast
</details>

<details>
<br>
<summary>What are the outputs from this product? </summary>
<h5>DHPS produces analyses in near real-time and forecasts over the next six days. From the analyses and forecasts, DHPS
provides hourly estimates of:</h5>
<li> River discharge and;</li>
<li> The volume of water stored in the river channel or at the outlet of an explicitly represented natural lake or regulated reservoir </li>
<br>
<h5>DHPS also provides analyses and forecasts of some variables  averaged 
over the surface of specified large lakes (listed above) during successive 12-hour periods. Those variables are:</h5>
<li>Precipitation </li>
<li>Evaporation </li>
<li>Terrestrial runoff </li>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I access the data? </summary>
<br>
<p> <i> Currently DHPS data is only available through ECCC's internal Science Network</i> </p>
</details>


<details>
<summary>What is the file structure and format?</summary>
<br>
<i> Currently DHPS data is available in NetCDF file format, click   <a href = "../../../data_access/file_formats/file_formats">  here  </a>  information on file formats 
<br>
<br>
<h4> <i>.tar</i> package for each run contains the following: </h4>
<ul>
<li> Twelve hours of river discharge analyses. The analyses correspond to the hour preceding the issue hour.For example, the <code> YYYYMMDDT13Z </code> file contains analysis for the hour starting 12:00Z and ending 12:59Z.  </li>
<li> Average of twelve hours of spatial analyses for evaporation, precipitation, and total runoff for the Great Lakes, Great Slave Lake, Great Bear Lake, Lake Athabasca, and Lake St. Clair.  
Drainage-Area. This is a constant field.  </li>
<li><code> FlowDir-Corrected </code> This is a constant field. It contains flow direction discrepancies between CCMEP’s fields and other organizations.  </li>
<li><code> Waterbody-ID </code> This file contains all bodies of water that are processed by the model explicitly. They are indexed numerically, starting at one. There are separate indexes for each basin, so as a result, the are six “1”s in this file.  </li>
<li><code> River-Discharge</code> There are a total of 144 files, one for each forecast hour.  </li>
<li> 12-hour accumulations of spatially averaged evap (<code>Evap-SpatialAvg</code>), precip (<code>Precip-SpatialAvg</code>), and runoff. There are a total of 12 files (012H to 144H). </li>
</ul>
