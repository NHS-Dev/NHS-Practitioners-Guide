## **High-Resolution (2.5 km) Ensemble Precipitation Analysis**

### **Overview**

<p>
HREPA is a system that provides a 24-member set of analysis for accumulations of high resolution precipitation over Canada and northern United States every 6-hours. 
HREPA produces one control member that is equivalent to a deternministic analysis, which combines observations from precipitation gauges and radar precipitation estimates (QPE's). 
The other members follow the same data assimilation approach but use randomly disturbed input data at each valid hour of the analysis.
The ensemble forecast from HREPA is currently integrated as an internal module in CaLDAS as a component of NSRPS.
