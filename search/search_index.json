The purpose of CaLDAS-Sat is to ingest both satellite and ground-based observations, while using land surface modelling and data assimilation techniques to generate optimal land surface states and fluxes. CaLDAS-Sat provides analyses of near-surface, surface, and sub-subsurface variables such as snow depth, 2-m atmospheric temperature, skin (land surface) temperature and soil moisture over most of Canada at a 2.5-km resolution. Analyses from CaLDAS-Sat are constructed by assimilating observations for these variables, but relys on satellite data for soil moisture retrievals and snow cover extent. Other systems such as DHPS and HRDPS retrieve initial land-surface and soil moisture conditions from CaLDAS-Sat. The land-surface scheme used by CaLDAS-Sat is Soil, Vegetation, and Snow (SVS).
