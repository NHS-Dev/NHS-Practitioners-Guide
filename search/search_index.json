The purpose of CaLDAS-Sat is to ingest both satellite and ground-based observations, while using land surface modelling and data assimilation techniques to generate optimal land surface states and fluxes. CaLDAS-Sat provides analyses of near-surface, surface, and sub-subsurface variables such as snow depth, 2-m atmospheric temperature, skin (land surface) temperature and soil moisture over most of Canada at a 2.5-km resolution. Analyses from CaLDAS-Sat are constructed by assimilating observations for these variables, but relys on satellite data for soil moisture retrievals and snow cover extent.

HREPA provides analyses and ensemble forecasts over Canada and the United States at a 2.5-km spatial resolution. What is available? What is the timestep and time period covered by this data? HREPA produces four sets of cumulative precipitation analyses every 6-hours (00, 06, 12, and 18Z) each day. What are the outputs from this product? HREPA provides a 24-member ensemble forecast and one control run of precipitation accumulations. How do I access the data?
