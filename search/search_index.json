Version summary Curent Version : 3.1.0 past versions : NA Product Summary: Attribute Description Spatial Domain 6 major basins in Canada Spatial Resolution 1-km grid Temporal Resolution Hourly Frequency 2x / day at 00 and 12 UTC Lead-time nan Current version 3.1.0 Domain NSPRS is currently implemented at a 1-km resolution over six major river basins representing ~50% of Canada. - brief summary domain describing that covers differs NSRPS is currently established in the following basins: Yukon River Basin Mackenzie River Basin Nelson River Basin Churchill River Basin Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River Basin System Components NSRPS is an integrated chain of numerical prediction systems, driven by high-resolution atmospheric forcing fields from the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS). The component systems of NSRPS include: High Resolution Ensemble Precipitation Analysis (HREPA) Purpose : Precipitation analyses Domain : Most of Canada plus transboundary areas of U.S. Spatial Resolution: 2.5 km Temporal Resolution : 6-hourly Frequency : 4x / day at 00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC Lead-time : 6 days (144 hrs) Current Version : Additional Information : Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS-Sat) Purpose : Land surface analyses Domain : Most of Canada plus transboundary areas of U.S. Spatial Resolution : 2.5 km Temporal Resolution : Hourly Frequency : 2x / day at 00 and 12 UTC Lead-time : NA Current version : 2.1.3 additional information : High Resolution Deterministic Land Prediction System (HRDLPS) Purpose : Land-surface predictions Domain : Most of Canada plus transboundary areas of U.S. Spatial Resolution : 2.5 km Temporal Resolution: Hourly Frequency : 2x / day at 00 and 12 UTC Lead-time : 6 days (144 hrs) Current Version : Additional Information : Deterministic Hydrological Prediction System (DHPS) Purpose : Flow analyses and predictions Domain : currently established in six major basins, including the Yukon, Mackenzie, Nelson, and Churchill rivers, the Great Lakes \u2013 St. Lawrence River basin, and the terrain draining into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The Columbia, Skeena and St. John rivers are currently in development.
