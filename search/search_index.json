DHPS only routes water generated by the surface model, and generally does not add or remove water to or from the outputs of the surface model.

It simulates lake levels for defined lakes or reservoirs and streamflow for all other points throughout the domain. DHPS is based on the Watroute routing scheme, and has the ability to represent reservoirs with a natural behavior as well as flow diversions. DHPS also assimilates streamflow observations during the data assimilation cycle.
