The purpose of CaLDAS-Sat is to ingest both satellite and ground-based observations, while using land surface modelling and data assimilation techniques to generate optimal land surface states and fluxes. CaLDAS-Sat provides analyses of near-surface, surface, and sub-subsurface variables such as snow depth, 2-m atmospheric temperature, skin (land surface) temperature and soil moisture over most of Canada at a 2.5-km resolution. Analyses from CaLDAS-Sat are constructed by assimilating observations for these variables, but relies on satellite data for soil moisture retrievals and snow cover extent. The land-surface scheme used by CaLDAS-Sat is Soil, Vegetation, and Snow (SVS).

DHPS performs the routing of liquid water leaving the surface model, which is then conveyed in streams and lakes throughout the modelling domain. DHPS only routes water generated by the surface model, and generally does not add or remove water to or from the outputs of the surface model. DHPS both analyses and forecasts water routed from CaLDAS-Sat and HRDLPS (respectively) through a river basin\u2019s lakes and rivers at a 1-km grid resolution. It simulates lake levels for defined lakes (listed below) or reservoirs and streamflow for all other points throughout the domain. DHPS is based on the Watroute routing scheme, and has the ability to represent reservoirs with a natural behavior as well as flow diversions. DHPS also assimilates streamflow observations during the data assimilation cycle. Currently, DHPS assimilates observations from ECCC\u2019s Water Survey of Canada, USGS, and the provincial networks of river gauges in Quebec and Alberta. DHPS produces hourly estimates, both analysed and forecast, of river discharge, the volume of water stored in the river channel or at the outlet of an explicitly represented natural lake or regulated reservoir, and the depth of the water in the subterranean reservoir. Current version: 3.1.0 What is the spatial resolution and coverage of this data? Outputs from DHPS are currently implemented at a 1-km resolution over six major river basins representing ~50% of Canada. DHPS is currently established in the following basins: Yukon River Basin Mackenzie River Basin Nelson River Basin Churchill River Basin Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River Basin DHPS also estimates the water budget of large specified water bodies, which include: The five Laurentian Great Lakes Lake Champlain Lake Athabasca Great Slave Lake Great Bear Lake What is available? What is the timestep and time period covered by this data? Twice a day, launching at 00 and 12 UTC, DHPS performs a 12-h data assimilation cycle followed by a 6-day forecast. DHPS produces hourly discharge forecasts, as well as 12-h forecasts and 24-h analyses of hydrological variables. What are the outputs from this product? DHPS produces analyses in near real-time and forecasts over the next six days. From the analyses and forecasts, DHPS provides hourly estimates of: River discharge and; The volume of water stored in the river channel or at the outlet of an explicitly represented natural lake or regulated reservoir DHPS also provides analyses and forecasts of some variables averaged over the surface of specified large lakes (listed above) during successive 12-hour periods.

The analyses correspond to the hour preceding the issue hour.For example, the YYYYMMDDT13Z file contains analysis for the hour starting 12:00Z and ending 12:59Z. Storage-River-Channel River channel storage forecasts. There are six files, one for every 24 forecast hours from 24 to 144 hours. Storage-LowZone Contains Depth of water in the lower zone storage or subterranean reservoir (kg/m2). Refer to the technical documentation for a detailed description of LZS in WATROUTE. Average of twelve hours of spatial analyses for evaporation( Analysis_Evap-SpatialAvg12h ), precipitation( Analysis_Precip-SpatialAvg12 ), and total runoff ( Analysis_Total-Runoff-Avg12h ) for the Great Lakes, Great Slave Lake, Great Bear Lake, Lake Athabasca, and Lake St. Clair. Evaporation and precipitation are averaged over the lake area. Runoff represents the total runoff into a body of water from its immediate watershed, distributed over the surface of that body of water or its immediate watershed. In the resulting files, every lake grid cell contains the spatial-temporal average value for the given variable. Drainage-Area This is a constant field that defines the area of the terrain that drains into a given grid cell, including the grid cell itself. FlowDir-Corrected Containing corrected flow directions underlying the river network of a modelling domain. Values range from 1 to 128, incremented by powers of 2, progressing clockwise starting from 1 to indicate East and ending with 128 to indicate Northeast. All bodies of water that are represented explicitly by the model are assigned a value of 256. Waterbody-ID This file contains all bodies of water that are processed by the river-routing model explicitly. They are indexed numerically, starting at one. There are separate indexes for each basin, so as a result, the are six \u201c1\u201ds in this file. For additional details, please see the technical note. River-Discharge Forecasted river discharge. There are a total of 144 files, one for each forecast hour. Forecasts of 12-hour accumulations of spatially averaged evaporation ( Evap-SpatialAvg ), precipitation ( Precip-SpatialAvg ), and runoff( Total-Runoff-Avg ).
