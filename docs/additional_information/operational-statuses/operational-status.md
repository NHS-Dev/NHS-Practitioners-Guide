## **CMC Run types**

<p> 
A run is when a suite (or system) is executed repeatedly and monitored. Different run types have different permissions, computation priorities, setup instructions, and monitoring conditions according to operational prediction systems tech transfer.
Tech transfer describes the processes of moving a run from one type to another type.

#### Definitions 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<dl>
<dt><b>Operational</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>

An Operational run is continiously monitored and has full operational status. 

</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Pre-operational</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>

A pre-operational (or stage) suite is intended to replace the existing parallel suite. . It is first validated against the corresponding parallel one after 24-hour period, and will be archived into the parallel trunk and branches.
The soon-to-be-replaced parallel suite will be turned off thereafter.

</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Parallel</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>

A parallel run is run alongside (in parallel) to an existing, stable system. The two systems are then compared.
Typically, parallel runs do not produce live products delivered to external clients. A parallel suite is setup either wehn there are major improvements, fixes
or modifications to an existing operational system, or when there is a new soon-to-be operational system. A parallel run ensures changes and modifications will work and perform as 
expected withouth impacting the current operational system. 

</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Development</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>

A development run is usally not a monitored system. Development runs are often used to test and evaluate new systems, and monitoring 
such systems is the responsibility of the developer.
