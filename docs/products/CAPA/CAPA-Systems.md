## **Canadian Precipitation Analysis System (CaPA)** 

### **Overview**

<p>

The Canadian Precipitation Analysis System (CaPA) produces a best estimate of 6 and 24h precipitation amounts. This objective estimate integrates data from precipitation gauge measurements, radar precipitation estimates (QPE's)
and a trial field generated by a numerical weather prediction system.
Currently there are deterministic and ensemble configurations of CaPA systems.

### **Deterministic Analyses** 

CaPA 'deterministic' produces four analyses of 6 hour amounts valid at synoptic hours (00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC) and two 24 hour analyses valid at 00 and 12 UTC.
A preliminary production is started 1 hour after valid time and a final one is launched 6 hours later.
There are two deterministic versions of the analysis: 
<ul>
<li>  <a href = "../../RDPA/RDPA-5.2.0">  Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (RDPA) </a> </li>
<li>  <a href = "../../HRDPA/HRDPA-5.1.0">  High Resolution Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (HRDPA) </a> </li>
</ul>

### **Ensemble Analyses** 

CaPA ‘ensemble’ produces four sets of analyses of 6 hour amounts per day valid at synoptic hours (00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC). The production is started 1 hour after valid time and each set of analyses contains 24 members plus the control member.
Currently, there is only one version of this system running at high resolution:
<ul>
<li>  <a href = "../../HREPA/HREPA-1.3.0">  High Resolution Ensemble Precipitation Analysis (HREPA) </a> </li>
</ul>
