## **National Surface and River Prediction System (NSRPS)**

### **Overview**

<p> NSRPS (also known as GEM-Hydro) is a <a href="../../NSRPS/diagrams/GEM-Hydro_schematic_current.png"> network of independent modelling systems </a> , which aims to provide the best possible representation of the current and future states of the land surface, as well as the movement of water over and through the soil column and through the lake and river networks. NSRPS is an integrated chain of numerical prediction systems, driven by high-resolution atmospheric forcing fields from the 
High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS). The component systems of NSRPS include: </p>
