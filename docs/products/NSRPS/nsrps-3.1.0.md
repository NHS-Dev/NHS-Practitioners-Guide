# **National Surface and River Prediction System (NSRPS)**

## **Overview**

<p> NSRPS is a Complete hydro-meteorological prediction system, which aims to provide the best possible representation of the current 
and future states of the land surface, as well as the movement of water over and through the soil column and through the lake and river networks. </P>

** Current version: ** 3.1.0
<br>
<!-- ** Past versions: **

* [1.0](./path/to/old_version.md)
* [2.0](../../license/license.md) -->


## **Domain**

<p>Discharge outputs from NSPRS are currently implemented at a 1-km resolution over six major river basins representing ~50% of Canada.

NSRPS is currently established in the following basins: 
<ul>
<li> Yukon River Basin </li>
<li> Mackenzie River Basin </li>
<li> Nelson River Basin  </li>
<li> Churchill River Basin </li>
<li> Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River Basin </li>
</ul> 
</p>

 <p> As NSRPS is composed of different sub-systems, both the domain and spatial resolution vary based on the which sub-system the output is derived. </p>
 
## **System Components**
<p> NSRPS is an integrated chain of numerical prediction systems, driven by high-resolution atmospheric forcing fields from the 
High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS). The component systems of NSRPS include: </p>

* [High Resolution Ensemble Precipitation Analysis (HREPA)](./path/to/old_version.md)
* [Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS-Sat)](./path/to/old_version.md)
* [Deterministic Hydrological Prediction System (DHPS)](../../products/DHPS/DHPS-3.1.0.md)
* [Simulation Hydrodynamique Opérationnel (SHOP)](./path/to/old_version.md)
